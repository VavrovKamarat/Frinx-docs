#### New Features, Improvements

1.  Clustering changes:

    * Reduced number of shards to 4: default-config, default-operational, prefix-configuration-shard-config, prefix-configuration-shard-operational
    * Modified raft election mechanism to move shard leaders to the same node, all shards will eventually have leaders on one node
    * Entity ownership is based on which node hosts the shard leaders

2.  Modified daexim, including startup changes, described at <https://frinxio.github.io/Frinx-docs/FRINX_ODL_Distribution/FRINX_Features_Developer_Guide/daexim.html>

3. cli, unified-topology, l2vpn, l3vpn projects added


#### Known Issues

1.  daexim:
    *   daexim import does not work.
2.  odl-netconf-clustered-topology:
    *   contains critical bugs and is not intended for production use, so odl-netconf-topology was modified so that it can work in cluster. Due to the fact that each node maintains its own connection to netconf devices, connection status reported in operational datastore might be overwritten and not reflect actual state.
3.  restconf/operational/entity-owners:
    *   entity-owners contains no data as entity ownership service was rewritten. Entity owners are assigned to the same node that hosts shard leaders.
4.  Operational state of IOS device cannot be read when VRF is configured on the device and the device is mounted via SSH.
5.  CLI telnet connectivity with reverse telnet on Cisco devices [see here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_usr_ssh/configuration/15-mt/sec-usr-ssh-15-mt-book/sec-rev-ssh-enhanmt.html) is not supported in this release.
6.  When a specific query is issued with regards to a child reader e.g. AreaReader in OSPF for XR, default data is being returned for non-existent instances.
