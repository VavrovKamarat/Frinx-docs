User Guide
========================

FRINX Machine is a dockerized deployment of 3 element. 
Every one of them have specific responsibilities.

FRINX Opendaylight (network automation solution)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  Connects to the devices in network

* 
  Keeps connections between devices alive

* 
  Pushes configuration data to devices

* 
  Pulls configuration and operational data from devices

Netflix Conductor (workflow engine)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  Chains atomic tasks into complex workflows

* 
  Defines, executes and monitors workflows (via REST or UI)

Elasticsearch (inventory and log data)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* 
  Storing inventory data

* 
  Storing log data

**The goal is to provide a platform enabling easy definition, execution and monitoring of complex workflows using FRINX Opendaylight.**

An example workflow could consist of:


#. 
   Pulling device IP and mgmt credentials from an external IPAM system

#. 
   Mounting a device

#. 
   Verifying the device is connected

#. 
   Executing a configuration template

#. 
   Unmounting a device

We chose Netflix’s conductor workflow engine since it has been proven to be highly scalable open-source technology that integrates very well with FRINX Opendaylight. Further information about conductor can be found at:

Defining a workflow
-------------------

Workflows are defined using a JSON based domain specific language (DSL) by wiring a set of tasks together. The tasks are either control tasks (fork, conditional etc) or application tasks (e.g. encode a file) that are executed on a remote machine.

FRINX Machine distribution comes in with number of pre-packaged workflows.

Detailed description of workflow and task definitions along with examples can be found at official `Netflix Conductor documentation <https://netflix.github.io/conductor/metadata/#workflow-definition>`_.

Starting a workflow
-------------------

Initiate **Workflow UI** 


#. Open web browser
#. Type localhost:5000 

Navigate to: 


* Metadata

  * Workflow Defs

There is a list of all available workflow definitions.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Choose one and switch to tab **Input**\ :

Input
^^^^^

Workflows are supplied inputs by client when a new execution is triggered. 

Workflow input is a JSON payload that is available via ``${workflow.input...}`` expressions.

Each task in the workflow is given input based on the inputParameters template configured in workflow definition. 

``inputParameters`` is a JSON fragment with value containing parameters for mapping values from input or output of a workflow or another task during the execution.

Start workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fill in JSON generated input fields. Input fields may contain default value or description provided in workflow definition. 

Press the button **Execute workflow** in order to start current workflow. 

**Console log** section at the bottom provides status information about workflow execution.

Executed workflows can be found at **Executions** tab on top of the collumn in menu on the left.

Inspecting executed workflows
-----------------------------

Navigate to:


* Executions

  * All

Then, search and filter for specific workflows.

After clicking on specific workflow, you are able to see its details including outputs as well as other information about current workflow.

Workflow actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workflow actions are available after clicking on specific executed workflow. 

You are able to execute these actions to a specific workflow:


* terminate
* rerun
* restart
* retry
* pause
* resume

Running previously executed workflow as new workflow with same or edited inputs:

Navigate to **Edit Input** tab, where you are able to edit specific inputs and run workflow again.
